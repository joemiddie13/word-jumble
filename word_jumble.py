Word Jumble Solver

This program demonstrates how to use efficient data structures and algorithms
to solve word jumble puzzles commonly found in newspapers.

This implementation applies several key concepts from ACS 2130 Core Data Structures:
- Hash Tables for efficient anagram lookup (O(1) time complexity)
- Algorithm Analysis for choosing optimal approaches and understanding complexity
- Set data structures for fast word membership testing
- Principles of problem decomposition similar to recursive techniques
- Counter objects for tracking letter frequencies (similar to queue processing)
