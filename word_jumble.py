Word Jumble Solver

This program demonstrates how to use efficient data structures and algorithms
to solve word jumble puzzles commonly found in newspapers.

Key concepts:
- Hash tables for O(1) anagram lookup
- Sorting as a strategy for anagram identification
- Using positional indexing to extract specific letters
